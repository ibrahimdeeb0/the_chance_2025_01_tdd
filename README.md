# Kotlin Algorithm Test Project

This repository includes test cases and implementations for two core algorithms written in Kotlin:

- ✅ **Sudoku Solver**: A backtracking-based solution to validate and solve Sudoku puzzles.
- ✅ **IPv4 Address Checker**: Validates whether a given string is a correct IPv4 address.

These algorithms are implemented with unit tests to ensure correctness and robustness.  
Ideal for learning/testing Kotlin syntax, logic structuring, and algorithmic problem solving.

## How to Run
Clone the project and run the test suite using your preferred IDE or the Kotlin CLI.
